# js-aruco markers

[js-aruco](https://code.google.com/p/js-aruco/) is a great augmented reality lib in javascript, based on [ArUco](http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26), a lightweight RA based on OpenCV.

This is a simple html page that generate the possible markers in canvas, so you can save the image, print them or generate them on demand.

You can clone this repo and access index.html or include markers.js and call makeMarker(id,width,height) which will return a canvas element drawn.
